-- JS: History --
Developed in 10 days the mid-90's by Brendan Eich for the NetScape browser
https://thenewstack.io/brendan-eich-on-creating-javascript-in-10-days-and-what-hed-do-differently-today/
Standerdized by Ecma (formally the European Computer Manufactures Association) in 1997 (JS is often referred to as ECMAScript)
Began taking over the browser world by the mid-2000s with the rise of competing browsers using AJAX
ES5 - older, core language we will start learning about

ES6 / ES 2015 - a major series of changes to the language with a lot of added syntactic sugar
ES 2016 - the beginning of TC39 process https://2ality.com/2015/11/tc39-process.html
ES 2017
ES 2018
ES 2019
ES 2020
-- JS Definition: High Level / Interpreted / Dynamically Typed / Programming Language  --
The dominant language for client-side (browser) scripting
JS also used server-side (using Node JS)
Low-Level programming languages typically use more verbose code to write more explicit instructions to be executed by the system running the code.
*High-Level programming languages typically use shorter and simpler syntax to write more implicit instructions to be executed by the system running the code.
LOW ABSTRACTION
Binary (101010 01010001 010001010 0100101001)
->Assembly
->C
->C++
->C# / Java
->PHP / JavaScript / Python
->SQL
-> Human Language
-> Graphical symbolism
HIGH ABSTRACTION
*Interpreted: code runs through an interpreter before being executed vs. compiled first then run directly.
*Dynamically typed: variable types determined when code runs, not when written, also may change between different data types.

-- JS: Uses --
By far the most common and perhaps the most important programming language in web development, especially client-side scripting:
- Facilitate user interaction on a page
- Dynamically change the content and styling of a page
- Listen and respond to events on a page (clicks, scrolls, passage of time, keyboard presses, etc.)
- Make HTTP requests to retrieve data without a page refresh (AJAX)
Can be used for back end/server-side programming (Node.js)
Browsers typically contain a graphical engine and a JavaScript engine (e.g. V8 for Google Chrome)
The JavaScript engine runs JavaScript code that may be running on a web page
***See examples of sites without JS***
JavaScript will be our first language to handle procedural logic (if blank, blank happens...)
Much of what we learn will transfer over to Java and other programming languages.

================================= JAVASCRIPT INTRO
https://www.w3.org/wiki/JavaScript_best_practices
Console
Comments
Running code
Expressions vs. Statements (can resolve to a single value vs. actions of the code)
================================= DATA TYPES (w / exercise)
6 Primative Types (immutable)
boolean - truthy / falsy
number
string
undefined
symbol
bigInt
1 Weird Type
null (can be treated as a primative type)
Everything else is an object (even functions)
Built-in Objects: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects#Standard_objects_by_category

Web API Objects: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API

Global Window Object: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window
================================= OPERATORS (w / exercise)
typeof
math operators
modulus
concatentation
logical operators
comparison operators
type coercion vs. conversion
https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/js-type-coercion-explained-27ba3d9a2839/
data types can be coerced into one of the following:
boolean
number
string
================================= VARIABLES
Variable: A container for a value, referred to by a declared placeholder name
- don't use reserved words
- use camelCase
- keep it semantic but not too long
Constant: A sealed container for a value, referred to by a declared placeholder name
================================= PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER (w / exercise)
Shorthand assignment operators
Unary operators
pre-increment/decrement vs. post-increment/decrement
Converting between strings and numbers
String methods
-- Example Exercise --
You own a lawn mowing business. You charge $30 per hour and can mow 5 standard residential lawns per day. Assuming you make  $1200 a week working 5 days per week, what is the average number of billable hours per lawn?
var hourlyRateDollars = 30;
var weeklyRevenueDollars = 1200;
var dailyLawnsMowed = 5;
var businessDays = 5;
var weeklyNumberOfLawns = businessDays * dailyCustomerAmount;
var averageBillableHoursPerLawn = (weeklyRevenueDollars / weeklyNumberOfLawns) / hourlyRateDollars;
